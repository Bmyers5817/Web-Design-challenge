As per the instuctions, the index.html file was created first which also is considered the landing page for this exercise.  For consistency, the navigation section was used for all htmls / screens.  In addition to the landing page, the cloudiness, temperature, humidity, and windspeed screens also include the visualizations container where one can navigate to another screen by clicking on the visual.

The landing page, includes the ability to navigate using the images or menu items.  Also, the screen will adjust if the screen is size is reduced below 750 pixels.

In order to show the data, the data.py was created to pull in the csv file and populated the data.html file so that the data screen is populated with the same table.

Lastly, the style.css was created to allow for styling and adjustments for screen size changes.
